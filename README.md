## üì¶ Included Nodes:
- **DownloadAndLoadDepthCrafterModel**: Will fetch the model files need to run DepthCrafter and save them under models/depthcrafter.
- **DepthCrafter**: Renders out depthmap videos given the following inputs:
  - **depthcrafter_model**: (input from the first node)
  - **images**: (single or batch),
  - **max_res**: the maximum resolution of the input images, supports increments of 64 pixels. (Larger resolutions require more VRAM)
  - **max_inference_steps**: more steps may result in less artifacts in the output, but will take longer to render.
  - **guidance_scale**: (1 - 1.2 recommended)
  - **window_size**: the length of the context window for DepthCrafter. You can lower this to save on VRAM at the expense of taking longer to render (75-110 recommended)
  - **overlap**: how much to overlap each context window to render longer videos > 110 frames. (25 recommended)
